### A Winter Trip To Goa

Work's been busy for both average birders this year, and a great deal of holiday needed spending before it was over.

Much research was done to find a warm place with respectable avifauna in November; it's not a month for cheery birding in the UK.

After a brief fling with the idea of the Gambia (ended by the demise of Thomas Cook), we eventually chose to go to Goa.

### The Itinerary

We flew direct from Gatwick to Goa. We spent a couple of days recovering from the flight in the capital, Panaji. After that, we travelled to North Goa, to stay on Morjim beach. Finally we travelled to South Goa, staying in Patnem.

### Research

We looked at some stuff.
