title: Essex Reconnaissance

### Essex Reconnaissance

Fresh back from the Wales trip, we realise that holidays are much better than
 work. Let's go camping in Essex for a weekend to escape again.
 
...and while we're there, let's visit a few birding places. We're mid
-September; a bit of a dead zone, but with a bit of luck we might catch up
 with a migrant or two on the way back to Africa.
 
Pronoun guidance: AB1's the cricketer.

#### On the way: Blue House Farm EWT

My only previous knowledge of [Blue House](https://www.essexwt.org.uk/nature-reserves/blue-house-farm) is playing a cricket team of the
 same name. I've no idea whether there's any link between the two.

Getting here is somewhat exciting - we're into enough of an extremity of
Essex that the roads start to get a bit tight, and the track down to the car
park is rough enough to encourage caution.

We exit the car; the weather is all over the place. Hot but also super windy.
A recipe for a sunburnt AB2; we'll need to do the sunblock dance before we
go any further. While we do, a flock of goldfinches raid the birdfeeders at
the other end of the car park.

We head out into the reserve, and the immediate impression is one of extreme
parchedness; the ground is hard, dusty and cracked. The satellite images of
the reserve from Google maps suggested there was wetland here; and while
there are reedbeds, dykes, and a nearby river, vast tracts that we guess are
usually watercourses are bone dry.

The reedy borders of the remaining watery bits are decently productive though
- we quickly find Stonechat, as well as Reed Bunting. A few flighty Yellow
Wagtails make a brief appearance as well. Our best bird on the way out to
the sea wall path though is a very friendly Northern Wheatear.

Once we're on the sea wall, mostly all we've got is gulls (Black-headed) and
geese (Canada); there is still an occasional Reed Bunting in the watery reedy
bit on the landward side of the wall.

We finish our circuit and head off in search of somewhere to camp; we
 eventually pitch up [here](http://www.greenlanecampingandcaravanning.co.uk/).

There's still plenty of daylight left, so we head out to Stow Maries. Firstly
because [the Prince of Wales](https://www.prince-stowmaries.net/) is there,
and secondly because we fancy a walk around the aerodrome; several TV
programmes have gone on about the owls here, so we want to have a look.

This proves trickier than we thought; almost as soon as we're on the footpath
we start to encounter hard to parse "footpath diversion" signs. We
eventually manage to walk the perimeter of the aerodrome; the internals
appear to be offlimits for today - there's some sort of model aircraft event
happening. It looks broadly quite entertaining - the models are flight worthy;
one in particular really tests our "is that small, or far away?" ability 
before it lands, and we see that it could only ever be piloted by a small
terrier.

The walk doesn't turn up any owls (we're none-the-wiser as to what the status
of birding is at the Aerodrome; next time we'll actually ring them I think),
but the footpath does take us through a surprise vineyard on the way back.

Thankfully the pub makes up for it; a raucous bunch of gentlemen provide
great background entertainment, the beer is _superb_ and the food isn't far
behind. We also get to watch highlights of a very exciting Tour de France time
trial, where Tadej Pogacar surprisingly outdoes his (rather poorly TT-helmeted) 
countryman Primoz Roglic.

We return to the campsite for a closing pint and a hilariously Essex
conversation with what we guess is the proprietor and an acquaintance of his.
 
#### Wallasea

We've made a brief visit to Wallasea before, and it rather whet our appetite
; the place had serious atmosphere. I've been itching to try out getting to
it via the [Burnham Ferry](http://www.burnhamferry.co.uk/) and the time has
finally come to give this a try.

We miss the first ferry in the slow acquisition of two bacon sarnies, but
adding thirty minutes of sitting in the sun on the waterfront is no real
hardship. We eventually board the second crossing with four serious looking
cyclists (and their bikes), who have a hard time getting down the jetty in
their road shoes.

The river crossing is uneventful, and we alight at the marina on the other
side of the Crouch. Wow. There are some serious boats here. Where do the
owners live? Do they all rely on the ferry, or do they drive up from
Southend whenever they fancy a jolly? We guess the latter.

Our plan takes us out along the sea wall; or at least, it does until I work
out that the grassland at the base of the sea wall is sheltered from the
devil wind holding us up on the top. An age passes before we enter the
reserve properly. Sadly, the Corn Bunting security guard that greeted us at
the car park [last time](/features/a-200-bird-year/part-10-an-excuse-for-essex.html) is
elsewhere.

We've got a lot more time to play with on this visit, and...it looks like
more of the reserve is ready for visiting. We plot a decently ambitious
circuit around [the reserve](https://www.rspb.org.uk/globalassets/downloads/documents/reserves/wallasea-island-trail-guide.pdf),
out to the Half Moon viewpoint via the Allfleets marsh trail, and then back
via the Beagle viewpoint. Perfect!
 
Until we make a start, and, having picked up a few more Yellow Wagtails in
one of the ditches, discover that the Allfleets marsh trail is temporarily
off limits. We rejig our plans (the New Pool trail wasn't a thing when we
 visited, or we couldn't find it) to just do the Marsh Flats trail instead.
 
We see lots of Shelduck, and a Kestrel, and some very lost looking tourists, and
that's about it. It's a nice walk in the sun though, and we find a shortcut
back to the road to save doubling back from the car park, to the relief of a
still complaining knee.

The only remaining action before catching the ferry back to Burnham is to
hear the long list of complaints a nearby resident has about the RSPB, the
finances of the nearby marina, and several other important local issues. I
eventually blurt out that we urgently need lunch and we escape. Maybe don't
live in such an isolated place if you like talking so much, Mr. Wallasea?

#### Bradwell and the Dengie

We pick up two _superb_ bagels from [Peaberries](https://www.peaberriescoffee.co.uk/)
and head out for Bradwell, on the basis that anywhere with a nuclear power
station tends to be pretty good (evidence: [Dungeness](/features/a-200-bird-year/part-37-dungeness.md),
Sizewell, Wylfa). There's also some historical nonsense that AB2 is broadly
 interested in. And a [bird observatory](https://www.ebws.org.uk/birdsites/bradwell-bird-observatory-bbo)!
 
Bird wise, this is, again, a bit of a dead zone. The dry wit of the
inhabitants of the observatory is the best bit of the visit. "There's not
much about now, the tide's in" "What are you expecting to see once the tide's out?"
"More mud". Heh; I wasn't expecting that level of snark. "You want
to come back in about a month; then things will start to happen" - wise
advice, which we will heed in a non-COVID year!
