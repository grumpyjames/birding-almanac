### Welcome to Average Birding

A birding website by average birders. Why should we make such an average website? Well, on average, it'll be able to teach half a person something.

See the <a href="/about.html">about page</a> for a longer explanation.

What species of average things will happen here? 

Well, we've thought of at least two different <a href="/features/index.html">features</a>, which will soon start to bear fruit.

There'll be sporadic <a href="/blog">blogging<a/> for when some birding of note happens that we can't shoehorn into a feature.

Finally, for places we go a lot, we'll maintain a set of <a href="/sites/index.html">site guides</a> so folks who might not have visited them as much can enjoy them as much as we do.
