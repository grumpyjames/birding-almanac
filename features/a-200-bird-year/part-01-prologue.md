### Prologue

Where does this idea of a two hundred bird year come from?

I think, in my case, it came from my Mum. Where she got it from, who
knows. The concept of a [Big
Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_year) seems to have existed,
in the US at least, for a long time, but if I try and put a finger on
why a two-hundred bird year has become a thing in the UK, it is a
little unclear.

Lev Parikian's excellent (and inspirational!) [Why do birds suddenly
disappear](https://unbound.com/books/why-do-birds-suddenly-disappear/)
also uses 200, but his reason is, basically, that a good birding friend of
his managed 206, so he should go for 200, a nice round number.

There are some features on [this
site](https://www.birdwatching.co.uk/my-200-bird-list) that suggest
that, at some point, Birdwatching magazine encouraged 200 as a target,
indeed, they still seem to be [promoting
it](https://www.birdwatching.co.uk/my200). So perhaps a birding
acquaintance of Mum's got chatting to her about it having read that
magazine, and from there the idea was seeded.

In any case, I _do_ clearly remember putting together a spreadsheet
("2018 list plan") over Christmas in 2017, and agreeing with Mum that
we'd both give it a go.

We agreed on some rules:

1. The bird must be found in the United Kingdom, strict definition
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom)

2. The bird must be seen. Hearing it is not enough, even for species
(e.g Tawny Owl or Cuckoo) where the sound of the bird is
unmistakable. Other people are allowed to find it and point it out,
though.

3. The bird must be wild. No going to an aviary and cheating. This
also excludes the occasional birds that escape from aviaries, so watch
out for rings that suggest that, particularly on wildfowl and
overly-sociable raptors.

4. We will accept feral species like Mandarin Duck and Greylag
Goose. Except Feral Pigeons, because, though we might have low
standards, we do at least have _some_ standards.

To prepare, we work our way through the [bird
book](https://www.nhbs.com/collins-bird-guide-book) (it really is
_the_ bird book), classifying 253 different species as either
Easy/Medium/Hard/Very Hard. 

*Side note*: the Collins book is _thorough_.

Serious birders will no doubt be wondering - only 253? It is a fair
point - we are leaving some remaining 300+ unclassified.

In our defence, the book devotes four pages to terns that neither Mum
nor I (and I suspect most birders) have ever seen (in the UK, at
least). The most frequently seen species (Caspian Tern) is classified
as `V**`, i.e Vagrant (only one or a few records a year, or in most),
the other are `V***` or worse. Serious birders describe these species as
"Mega" if they turn up in the UK. We can't plan a trip to see these
species, so having them in the list _plan_ is a bit pointless. We can
always add an entry to the list if we come across it by being in the
right place at the right time.

Back to the planning spreadsheet. We note with interest that while one
can reach 105 with only easy species, only 178 are possible combining
the easy and medium species. We add a note or two as to where some of
the trickier ones might be located. I also add some hidden tracking
columns so the spreadsheet can do the counting for us - previous
birding challenges have involved rather more fragile methods of
performing the count, and have been occasionally prone to the odd
duplicate.

With our task set out for us, we look forward to the onset of the New
Year. In a previous attempt at a sizable year list I reached 168, so
success is in no way a foregone conclusion - finding those extra 32
will hopefully be fun!
