title: Part 03: Hertfordshire Hawfinches
---
### Hertfordshire Hawfinches

This week brings many reports of Hawfinches. Perhaps one or two might
still be reachable by the weekend.

As far as I can work out, *thousands* have turned up across the
country. None of them convenient enough for a mid-week bike
excursion. I spend the week sifting through the various sighting
reports to try and find the sweet spot for a weekend attempt. I've not
seen a Hawfinch before, so I don't much fancy having to pick one out
in flight; we want a decent sized flock with a reputation for sitting
about a bit. We also want to be able to get there using public
transport and a bicycle in under an hour and a half.

These criteria quickly boil the options down to one; a big flock has
frequently been seen in the back of a churchyard in
Bramfield. Accessibility isn't great; it's a half hour cycle at each
end of a forty minute train journey.

The cycle from Hertford North to Bramfield has some surprises, though;
a Red Kite floats above the road. A collection of blobs in a furrowed
field catches my eye as I cycle by. The bird book section of the brain
pipes up excitedly: "were those Grey Partridges?" Well, potentially,
but could you be quicker next time? I turn the bike around, retrace my
steps (pedal strokes?) and cast my eyes over where the blobs were.

Were being the operative word. As the area is now blob
free. Hmm. Quite the disappearing act. There are hints of bird
along the ridges of the furrows, but they could just as easily be
rocks. A watched field never boils, they say, so I briefly examine my
phone to make sure I'm still on the right track. I am. No further
report of Hawfinches has been recorded from up the road,
however. 

There, that ought to suffice. I glance quickly at the field, and what
were hints of blobs are now blobs once more, fooled into action by my
pretence of non-interest. Even better, they clearly _are_ Grey
Partridges; a bird I've never seen in the wild before. Hertfordshire's
already gone up in my birding estimation, and we're only a couple of
weeks into the year.

Bramfield isn't far from here, and it's cold, so the partridges
perhaps don't get the attention they deserve. A brief wrong turn adds
a couple of minutes to the remainder of the journey, but it's clear
where I'm supposed to be looking as I cycle through town; there's a
couple of folks with scopes malingering with intent at a churchyard
gate. I lock the bike to a nearby street sign and head in.

An excited collection of folks is gathered a few metres in, scanning
some conifers behind the church itself. I join in and immediately
clock a chunky looking finch near the top of one of them; it turns its
head to reveal a beak to inspire a new generation of crushing
machinery, and it's clear I've got a Hawfinch. The conifers yield two
or three more; then a good ten to fifteen more birds join them. This
was the right choice; no uncertainty in the diagnosis, no lengthy
twitch, a decent couple of ticks on the way there.

I spend a good half an hour in the churchyard helping the next
arrivals find the Hawfinches, and then set out home before the light
fails. The partridges are still in the same spot (now I've seen them
they seem disinclined to perform their vanishing act); the red kite
has been replaced by a kestrel; Hertford North offers a decent bacon
sandwich while you wait (i.e still warm, in bread that is not
completely stale, complimentary tomato ketchup); a pheasant hurriedly
scuttles into the undergrowth as the train back into London rushes
by. A most successful day out!
