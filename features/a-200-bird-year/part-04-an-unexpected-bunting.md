title: Part 04: An Unexpected Little Bunting
---
### An unexpected Little Bunting

This week's "please stay there until the weekend" report is a Little
Bunting at Walthamstow Reservoirs. (N.B Yes, the cover photo is of a Reed 
Bunting - read on for tale of why).

This post covers the period of January 15th-21st, 2018. Pronoun guidance: only 
AB1 would have been up for the expedition described below.

#### The weekend finally arrives 

Saturday is taken up by non-bird plans (!). By the time Sunday
arrives, it seems my luck is still, partially, in; the bird is
allegedly around. Only partially, mind; it feels like this
is the coldest London has been for quite some time and that's before the
windchill is factored in. Also, getting to Walthamstow is not particularly 
straightforward and either involves going in and then out again (Northern then 
Victoria), or a pesky pair of Overground trains.

This is _definitely_ a twitch. It's a good job AB2 is absent; this
would _not_ be her scene. There's a veritable horde of birders waiting
around where the bunting's been seen - a firing squad of scopes
awaits it. Some of them had success around an hour ago, but nothing's
been seen since.

As of now, we all stare at a row of leafless trees. Behind them, the 
River Lee quietly flows. Behind that stand some apartments, the residents 
of which must be feeling somewhat tormented by the amount of accidental 
attention their homes are receiving. Off to our left, the Warwick reservoir 
sits, contemplatively. Behind us is Reservoir No. 1 (I'm not sure how they 
have been ranked, but it feels good to be near the top seed).
 
Nothing is what continues to happen for quite some time. Even the Reed 
Buntings that were hopping about when I arrived have gone to ground; the 
longer grass and scrub around the tree line providing excellent cover. There 
isn't even any relief from the occasional Wood Pigeon; even they have been sensible
enough to read the forecast and batten down the hatches.

Speaking of the weather, it starts to get worse. The wind gets up, it starts 
to snow. Much of the effort that was going into scanning the tree line must 
now be spent on stamping of feet, cleaning of snow from binoculars, and 
wondering how long it's possible to stay here without developing hypothermia. 

A prominent local birder with a pristine East end accent and a giant
golf umbrella is remonstrating with...OK, it isn't clear who with, but what 
they are remonstrating about is the management of the reserve. Walthamstow 
was, until recently, managed by Thames Water. Last October (2017), it was 
opened up as a more publicly accessible site, with trails, and a new name: 
"Walthamstow Wetlands".

In short, the site went from "out of bounds to everyone except,
basically, a bunch of anoraks: fishermen and birders who obtained the
necessary permits" (thanks,
[Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/oct/19/walthamstow-wetlands-london-birdwatching-nature-reserve-free-entry))
to well promoted outdoor space open to everyone. Our local expert is
not impressed with how the change has been managed:

"There's no place for the wildlife anymore". "You get here now and
people are jogging along the tops of the reservoirs - think about the
disturbance that's going to make to the birds that inhabit the
edge" (Indeed, several joggers have done this and, my god, is that a buggy 
traversing the reservoir now too?). "No-one is enforcing the areas where dogs 
aren't supposed to go". 

There's something mildly entertaining about this litany; he's got
a point, and the delivery is excellent. Or possibly it's so cold that
I've started to go mad.

The snow gets heavier before it gets lighter. This is borderline
ridiculous; the visibility is such that the area where the
bird is supposed to be is obscured from view. Several folks head back
towards the visitor centre to shelter; the foolhardier of us (a good
ten or so) hang about, just in case.

Some time around 1pm the weather starts to clear a bit. I scrunch my
feet up inside my shoes, in an attempt to invoke the spirit of Die
Hard. A few littlies start to show some movement in the grassy patch
in front of us. A group of three birds flaps up into one of the trees
at the back of the patch. They're definitely buntings and the one
sitting at 10 'o' clock is decidedly paler, even in this half-arsed
wintry light (I'm not even slightly regretting not bringing the camera, and I
doubt my frozen fingers could operate it even if I had). Our umbrella toting
narrator pipes up: "Little Bunting!" and that's exactly what it is.

The bird hangs about for a fair old while at this point; long enough
for some of the less hardy crew to return from the warm sanctuary
of the visitor centre (some of them with steaming mugs of coffee in hand; bastards) 
to catch up with it, the lucky sods.

Having found the bird, I take a step outside myself and consider the sanity 
of having come out on such a twitch. Verdict: non-committal. One thing is for
sure - I am far, far too cold to visit the other side of the reserve, where 
there is apparently a Scaup. I'm too cold to even work out how to say
Scaup (scawp? scowp?). The only thing left to do is pick up a celebratory Subway on 
the way home. What a way to spend half a Sunday.
