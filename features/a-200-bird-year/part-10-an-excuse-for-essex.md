title: Part 10: An Excuse For Essex
---

### An Excuse For Essex

A pair of our friends from the North have roped AB2 into some charity
dinner and raffle. In Chelmsford. At the cricket club.

This looks above and beyond the call of duty. Unfortunately, the trains out to
Chelmsford that weekend are utterly hosed, and AB1 is unsure he can consign 
AB2 to waking up hungover in an Essex Travelodge with a two and a half hour 
journey home to look forward to.
 
Pronoun guidance: AB1 came to the rescue, and hired a car. Conditions were 
attached, however. This post covers the events of March 24th-25th, 2018.

#### The journey out

The middle of March was quiet; a short visit to WWT London in an
attempt to find Jack Snipe failed, but did contribute a reasonably
early Sand Martin (March 18th).

Several motives align; a persistent series of complaints from AB2 about 
having to go to this dinner on her own. The total absence of transport. The 
increasing absence of year ticks. Suffice to say: my motives for hiring a car
and attending this dinner are not entirely altruistic. Some of them are 
self-preservatory, in addition.

This thing in Chelmsford is, handily, in the evening. And I can think of no 
better way to spend the rest of the day than touring a few select birding 
sites in the nearby. Not least because I have absolutely no intention of 
trying to drive in and out of London anywhere between the hours of 9am and 9pm,
and that's going to give us a fair amount of day to play with.

#### Walthamstow Wetlands

A spanner is thrown into the works late on the Friday afternoon;
someone's found a Bluethroat at Walthamstow Wetlands (nee
reservoirs). It's _just about_ on the way to where we're going, and,
handily, is on the Victoria line, so, after a brief negotiation with
our Northern friends, we agree to pick them up from there. That should
give us a good hour to see if the Bluethroat has decided to stick
around.

It hasn't. We do catch up with the Little Bunting (yes, [the same one](/features/a-200-bird-year/part-04-an-unexpected-bunting.html))
on our way round (it's hanging out with its Reed Bunting friends, and
additionally, the first Linnets of the year), and, to my surprise, I
manage to pick out the Scaup (again, the same one) at the back of
reservoir number four without needing a scope. Smug. A tinkle of phone
noise informs us that our friends have arrived, so we return to the
car, and after a brief wrangle with the payment machinery at the car
park exit, we set off towards Essex proper.

#### Hanningfield Reservoir

Our first stop is supposed to be Hanningfield reservoir. We get nearby,
and quickly realise that our first stop is lunch. We sit at a table in
a pub making poor attempts at small talk (I mostly give these attempts
a thousand yard stare, as if to suggest my level of hanger is everyone
else's fault). Food eventually arrives and the collective mood
improves. Well, mine does. Everyone else is rather better balanced.

Back to Hanningfield. There's an extensive set of nature trails with hides
attached. There is also some sort of deal on plastic animal masks in
the visitor centre. I heave a deep sigh as I realise these are going
to prove distracting to everyone other than me, and decide that my
best option is to head out and have a quiet bit of solo birding before
anyone realises where I've gone.

Hanningfield is a big old reservoir, and, typical of all birding I
have done at reservoirs, all the interesting birds are as far away
from the hides as it is possible to get. On the side near the hide, a
mallard or two perform within ten metres or so.

On the far side, huge numbers of wildfowl are bobbing about. Among
them I am hoping to find Slavonian Grebe; a Winter visitor to most of
the UK that often turns up on reservoirs of this size. This shouldn't
be too tricky a bird to find if it's here - it has a very different
profile in the water to the other grebes (Great-crested, Little) that
might be here; someone's already done the tricking part of divining
that it is Slavonian and not Black-necked.

There's definitely something on the far side of the reservoir near the
causeways (no public access :-/) that fits the profile, but even in
the scope, it's barely more than a dot. There are no other scope toters
present, so I'm a bit stuck; "there's not much that could be other
than slav grebe" isn't enough to tick it. Humph.

Complaints from my phone tell me my disappearance has been noted; I
send word of my whereabouts and then try to give the other difficult
sods on the wrong side of the reservoir a bit of a look at, in case
they're of interest. Remarkably, some of them are - a little clutch of
ten of them have the detergent level pink-whiteness that only Goosanders
possess. Well, that's a nice bonus.

The remainder of the hides don't offer a great deal on top of that.
It's interesting that, for what I'd pegged as a 'wet' reserve, most of
the quality is in the woodland; we're spoilt for Treecreeper,
Goldcrest and the usual suspects all the way round. Besides a little
group of folks on a photography course (we guess the theme is 'small
stuff', as many of the hapless participants are spending a lot of time
staring at featureless branches in the hope of sudden insectile
appearance), it's also remarkably quiet. When I'm next wrangled into
Essex we'll probably pay this place another visit.

#### Wallasea Island

At this point, we need to drop our friends off in Chelmsford so they
can help get this event set up. Our arrival isn't due for another
three hours after that though, and I've got a bee in my bonnet about
getting to Wallasea Island. I've been planning a visit to this place
for years, and I've been stymied by illness, lack of trains, sudden
work commitments; you name it. Not today, though, I steely declare.

It's quite a pleasant drive from Chelmsford - the parts that aren't
Essex countryside idyll are mostly quiet bits of well maintained dual
carriageway. Just before you arrive at the reserve, the
landscape changes quite dramatically; someone takes the bleakness
level and turns it up to eleven. What was rolling, vivacious farmland becomes 
flat, treeless wilderness, laced with muddy streams and bordered by slowly 
salinating estuary. The road thins and develops some of the most violent
ramps known to mankind; rivalling even Minsmere's bone-shaking quality. It's 
quite a relief when we reach the car park.

The car park has room for perhaps fifteen vehicles. We are the third. A 
solitary Corn Bunting is playing security guard; it proudly sits
in a sapling off to the left. Tick. 

We've probably got an hour of daylight left - that should be enough
for a quick explore along the sea wall. A bundle of Black-headed gulls
to the South has some obvious looking Mediterranean Gulls amongst
them. There's a raptor sitting near what we suspect, on a warmer day,
would be a pleasant picnic area. We try and turn it into a Merlin, but
it stubbornly remains a Kestrel, despite our aggressive surveying of some 
serious-looking birders with more powerful optics.

The North of the sea wall has decent number of waders poking around on
it - some nice Curlew and Redshank. Some Shelduck float about
amiably. We scan a few distant landmarks for raptors (there's a huge
haystack in the distance that's supposed to be good for this, in
particular) and find nothing. 

AB2 retreats to the car (it's getting colder, and the wind is borderline 
unpleasant) and I hang about in the hope of a last-minute owl. This ought to 
be prime Barn Owl territory. Unfortunately, no one's told the Barn Owls. And 
now I too am also starting to feel the cold. I return to the car empty-handed
and steel myself for the return journey over the ramps of doom with a biscuit.

The charity dinner is no worse than I'd imagined (we win some Odeon
tickets in the raffle, and some of the people we meet are borderline
entertaining. Also, we have two good friends there). I pay the sober
price for deciding to drive home immediately afterwards, but it pays
off; we wake up in our own house the day after, and it feels great. I
celebrate with a visit to Regent's Park, where I fail to find a
Firecrest.
