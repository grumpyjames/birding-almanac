title: Part 11: The Search For Snipe
---

### The Search For (Jack) Snipe

The weekend arrives and presents one final opportunity to add to the
end of March total. Spring is starting to show its face; we opt for a
trip to Barnes.

(Yes, yes, the front page picture is a Cetti's, and no, no it isn't from 
Barnes either, sorry)

Pronoun guidance: AB1 had never self-found a Jack Snipe. This post covers the
events of March 31st, 2018.
 
### Early Spring in Barnes
 
This time, there's no sign of Bittern...but there have
been intermittent reports of Jack Snipe. Given the lack of urgency we
choose our usual route: Headley, wildside, visitor centre (option of
coffee), meander to peacock hide.

An explosion of noise to the left of the headley hide; a Cetti's
warbler is there. Not unusual for Barnes. What is unusual: I can see
the little git. They usually hide in the deepest depths of cover, but
at this time of the year they pop up a bit more frequently. It's a
relief to tick it off so early in the season.

The walk around wildside is noisy but tick-free. Wildside itself is
somewhat better. It overlooks two grassy verges that make up the
border of the grazing marsh, and this should be the time of year
during which chats, wagtails and Wheatear start to turn up. True to
form, there is indeed a Wheatear on the left hand verge; it bobs about
cautiously near the fence posts that help keep foxes out of the marsh,
and is basically charming. We put a few other visitors on to it before
heading back to the visitor centre for refreshment.

We take the long way round the the peacock tower round the back of the
sheltered lagoon. This tends to be good for warblers, and we manage to
pick up a Chiffchaff in one of the numerous silver
birches. Excellent. We take a brief sojourn in the scrape hide to
admire the smattering of sand martins before taking a seat on the top
floor of the peacock hide.

It's here that the real mission begins. Can we find one of these pesky
Jack Snipe? I've only ever been shown them before, and never actually
found one myself.There are apparently one or two around; they've been
seen on the islands of the wader scrape today, according to some folks
in the hide.

Best get comfortable; this could take a while. Jack Snipe are smaller
than their common brethren, their plumage provides better camouflage,
and they are typically far less keen to show themselves. There are
some Common Snipe around the edges of the island; that's actually
quite useful to establish a baseline in terms of scale.

The leftmost island, to me, looks most promising; it has the most
cover. The others are really just mud - it's quite easy to see that
their only inhabitants are Lapwings and Redshanks. A prolonged scan of
the left hand island it is, then.

I catch a glimpse of something that looks a more straw like brown and
with a shorter beak than the Common Snipe. Is it a bird, or is it an
assemblage of reedy grass? I try to switch from binoculars to scope
and lose all trace of it. Hmm. No, wait, there's something scuttling
between those two reedy patches, what's that? It's a Jack Snipe. I
emit excited noises, and unilaterally fail to direct AB2 (or anyone
else in the hide) on to it. 

This is problematic. Everyone in the hide is probably thinking what I
think in this situation, i.e: this idiot is making it up; what a dick!
Now I have to find it again, and direct _at least_ two people on to it
as well, one of whom must be AB2, or I'll never live this down.

This takes _significantly_ longer. Having just spent twenty whole
seconds in the open the Jack Snipe disappears for half an
hour. Tireless scanning from yours truly eventually relocates it
poking around right at the very back of the island. This time I stay
quiet, tighten all the bits of scope I can find to prevent wobble and
usher AB2 to have a look through it, which she does ("Oh, it does
look totally different; you weren't lying"). A couple of other birders
have found it simultaneously, and I can now safely leave free of
'making the whole thing up' suspicion. Relief all round.

March total: 121. Uh-oh, this is looking like a log curve.
