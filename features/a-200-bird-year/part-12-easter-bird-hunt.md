title: Part 12: Easter Bird Hunt

### Easter Bird Hunt

April arrives, and with it, hopefully, a flurry of new ticks from
spring migration.

Pronoun guidance: AB1 is the first person. This post covers the events of 
April 1st-6th, 2018.

#### Easter Sunday: Cassiobury Park 
 
After a successful Jack Snipe at Barnes the day before, it's time for another
trip to Cassiobury Park. An enthusiastic photographer claims to have found 
one earlier in the day, but on inspection, what they have is a female 
greater spotted woodpecker. I let them down gently, and they get on to 
talking about the Kingfishers they've been photographing upriver. This is 
interesting news, as I haven't seen one yet this year. Having stared at 
trees and seen nothing for far too long, I decide to change tack. Let's try 
and find this kingfisher instead.

I head off up the river and a Kingfisher rockets past me in the
opposite direction. That'll do. It'll probably also be the best I
manage; Kingfishers are notoriously shy, and there's nowhere for me to
take cover along here. A Grey Wagtail cheerfully bobs about on some
branches in the centre of the river (they're a terribly named bird;
yellow-bellied-ridiculously-long-tailed-but-really-pretty-smart
wagtail would be more accurate). A quartet of Mandarin Ducks floats by
on the far side. That, I suspect, is going to have to do...

#### Easter Monday: Up Dollis Brook

April 2nd is Easter Monday. [Samuel Levy](https://twitter.com/FinchleyBirder)
has heard a lesser spotted woodpecker while walking up Dollis Brook towards 
Totteridge. That's a walk we can do from our flat without too much difficulty.
The weather, though ominous, looks as if it may hold off until 1 or 2pm; if
all else fails, we're rarely more than a ten minute dash away from the bus
home.

This is not the most productive birding trip we manage. The path to
the brook is partially closed, so we end up taking a salubrious tour
of the North Circular's pavements. Delightful. When we manage to
intersect with the brook, it has big warning signs near it to stay out
of the water, for it is likely to be toxic. Nice.

The appearance of a Great-spotted Woodpecker just South of the Windsor
Open Space heralds a major improvement; the amount of refuse strewn
around is greatly reduced, there's something approaching a view, the
smell is less bad; and, in places, completely absent.

We pass under the attractive Dollis viaduct. There's a hint of rain in
the air. By the time we've walked alongside the golf club, it's more
than a hint, and by the time we start to get in range of the open
farmland part of this walk, it's chucking it down. Arse. We walk up
into West Finchley to intersect with a bus home. Not a walk we'd recommend.

#### Easter Week: A dash under the North Circular

Overexcitement/overoptimism leads me to take a pair of binoculars to
work, in case something interesting turns up in Regent's Park (on the
way home) or Barnes (a manic lunchtime rush). Nothing turns up until
Friday, when someone sticks a report of Hoopoe at Brent Reservoir on
birdguides.

This is, possibly, the least accessible site in London. I have cycled
to it once before and ended up briefly on the North Circular;
frightening. For the possibility of a Hoopoe though, it is worth the risk. 

Twenty minutes after leaving work, I am weaving my way _under_ the North 
Circular on some godawful three lane road. I mark the occasion by spending 
most of it yelling "aaaaaaarrrrggghhh" which seems to keep the other vehicles
away from me.

There is, of course, no bloody sign of any Hoopoe. Unlike my previous
visit, though, I do manage to work out where there hides are. Fortunately one
of them has some folks in it (otherwise, it'd be locked). They've heard about
the Hoopoe, but it's gone to ground some hours ago. There are a couple of 
Common Snipe poking around, and today's consolation prize: Three Little Ringed 
Plover. 

This area of the reservoir probably has as many species of rubbish as
it does birds. There are several pieces of car, miscellaneous
unidentifiable plastic and wire, bits of boat. Thankfully, the birds
don't seem to mind, and the brighter and larger pieces of rubbish act
as excellent landmarks when directing folks to a nearby bird.

The hint of a sandpiper (just a hint though!) as I entered the hide and the 
excellent company (for the other inhabitants are very friendly) keep me in the
hide until the light fails. I manage to trace a route home that's
considerably less dangerous than the North Circular, even if some of
the other people using it seem a bit threatening.
