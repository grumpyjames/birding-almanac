### The five ds of birding

Dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge. Dodgeball's a great film. Don't @ me. This 
weekend, a bit of all five things is in store. 

This post covers the events of May 12-13th 2018. Pronoun guidance: AB1 is 
well dodge.

#### Saturday: The dip, and some dodging

The short week rolls by, and news of Black-winged Stilts in the Thames
estuary trickles in.
 
They've been seen at Bowers Marsh RSPB; good - the other options on the North
are less accessible by public transport, or just a bit of a sod to bird (I'm
looking at you, Vange Marsh). I can string a decent walk out of a visit to 
Bowers as well; from Benfleet station back to Pitsea.

Duly kitted out with the scope bag, I set out from Benfleet. The public footpath
is well marked, but not so well maintained. Once again, I am made to regret my
choice of shorts.This time, unfortunately, thorns are involved and even at my
advanced age and with noticeable dodging skill, they manage to cause me some 
damage. I take out some of my anger by swearing at some black headed gulls for
being insufficiently interesting.

The rough ground between the station and the reserve itself is sufficiently 
scrubby to hold boatloads of Whitethroat. Are any of them Lesser? Probably, 
but the ones I can see are all Common. I stride onwards; these brambles 
aren't going to give up a tick today, I can feel it.

Crossing under the road to Canvey island, one enters the reserve
proper. I transition from an OS to an RSPB map and head towards the
reserve's viewing area where the Stilts have been seen. The omens are
not good. Birders are making egress from the watch point, and they are
stony faced, taciturn; paying attention to a stray Linnet or two, as
if that's the only thing of note they've seen all day. Hmm.

#### A definite dip

I reach the viewing area; the primary mood is frustration rather than
excited; no-one's clapped eyes on a Stilt all day. There's not exactly
that many places I'd expect a Stilt to attempt to hide on this series
of scrapes either. Still, plenty of other waders. Is there something
of interest hiding amongst them? Half an hour of scouring with the
scope has the answer: no. Still. Nice Avocets. A few minutes later I
become the same bad omen others were for me on the way in; the Stilts
aren't here, it's time to explore the rest of the reserve.

Some patchy rain follows me around; pesky, really - I'm not dressed
for it. Evidently no-one else is either, though; I don't see another
soul as I traverse the reserve's boundary path clockwise. A visit to
the saline lagoon provides an opportunity for a covert wee, but little
else. I return to the circular path and head towards what, from the
main viewing area, was the rear area of the lake.

There's a neat little reedbed channel alongside the path; a few Reed
Warblers are squawking in it. And, if my ears don't deceive me, at
least one Bearded Reedling. Oho. Now I just need to clap eyes on
it. In this channel, that seems hopeful; there's only three to four
metres of reeds and they aren't dense - oh, in fact, there they are; a
pair of them, to be precise. They're in a confiding mood; almost
getting close enough for a photo from my phone, but then flitting back
to the end of the channel and then starting back towards me.

I spend a good ten minutes watching this performance; it's the most interesting
thing to happen since the thorny path at the beginning, and I am restored by it.

It's a good job - the next twenty minutes of walk is fruitless; an
opposite view of the scrape yields no further interest, and the lumpy
parts at the back of the reserve hold nothing of interest. There are
some vocal cuckoos in the distance, but I suspect in the distance is
where they'll stay.
 
I am wrong. As I walk into Great Pound viewpoint, there's one sitting not ten
feet away from my in a spiky bush. It cuck-coos at me angrily and flaps off.
I instinctively cuck-coo back at it. A second bird, further back, responds in
kind (to whose call, it isn't clear; it's not like I can ask). A little 
further round the walk, my presence disturbs what I can only assume is the 
same two birds; they flap off West in search of even quieter pastures (I still
haven't seen anyone since leaving the watch point).

I pick my way around the remainder of the path, clap eyes on the first
humans I've seen for an hour and a half on the road out of the
reserve, and then turn left to pick my way through some very soggy
fields on the way to Pitsea. 

In a fit of madness, I don't get on the first train home from there, but 
plough on to have a look at Vange Marsh. This is a mistake. The lagoon, 
previously a mixed area of scrape where I've seen Wilson's Phalarope and 
Little Stint, is covered in algae, and the only thing alive on it are Mute 
Swans. For future reference, I have a good explore of the easternmost area of
the site, in case something happens in future and I don't want to spend half an
hour wondering how the hell to traverse the reserve.

I head back to Pitsea for the train home with an increased amount of
respect for the birders whose patch Vange Marsh is. And I wonder where
those stilts went.

#### Sunday: a duck; it dives

The next day brings news of a hopefully more reliable bird. Birdguides
is showing a female Smew on a lake near Cheshunt; the description has
'still' in it, and if I look on the website, it's been sporadically
reported for some weeks. It's quite surprising for this bird to still
be in the UK at this point - they are typically winter visitors only.

This ought to be a slam dunk tick. The instructions are detailed; the
bird is always found on the same lake on a nature reserve of what I
can only assume is old gravel pits (it's always old gravel pits). The
lake is a pleasant ten minute walk from a well serviced station
nearby.

In addition, it's a duck. So a.) it should be big enough to see, even
at distance and b.) the opportunities for it to disappear into a bush
forever are small. Wildfowl are often the gateway to birding as a
result of these two features, I feel.

We perform the necessary transport dance; the change at Seven Sisters
on to the National Rail network is as under construction as it always
seems to be. We alight at Cheshunt and spend a moment getting our
bearings. A nearby family is off on the same walk as us. Their
youngest daughter has other ideas though and is protesting loudly
about it. As we finally get underway, it turns out she was successful
- the same family have turned around and we pass them in the opposite
direction. Either that or they forgot something, or this walk is
_much_ shorter than we thought. Tears before bedtime, we expect.

A five minute walk down the River Lee Navigation, we reach a bridge,
and cross over. The path continues between the lake on the left and
the river at this point, but it's the lake on the left we're here for,
so we make a stop in an angler's spot on the shore to see what we can
see.

The answer is a lot of Coots, and a few Great Crested
Grebes. Unexpectedly, it appears some patience will in fact be
required; the Smew is not immediately visible - I think I was
expecting it to be putting on a performance within ten or twenty
metres of this little viewpoint. AB2 and I both put on our serious
birder faces and set about making a more serious examination of the
more distant parts of the lake.

There is a hint of something Smew like at the back - something
non-grebe and non-coot is swimming about and occasionally diving. Its
colouration rules out it being a Tufted Duck; but is the level of
detail with binoculars good enough to rule it into being a Smew? I
think it probably is; there's nothing else that really looks like
them, and I'm pretty confident I can see the chestnut forehead that
gives a female Smew its 'redhead' nickname. 

Now I just need to tell AB2 where it is. This is unexpectedly
tricky. The border of the lake's vegetation is too homogenous to offer
landmarks, and the Smew itself is unhelpfully spending at least half
of its time underwater. In the end, I daisy chain a description from
the front of the lake to the back, via some very specific Coots and a
very helpful Black-headed Gull. No, no, to the left of that grebe. The
other left. No, not that far; wait a bit, it's underwater. No, I'm not
making it up. There, it's there. Got it? Excellent.

Having successfully exited the making it up phase, we set the scope up
to have a better look and generally preen a little at having achieved
this trip's tick without having had to spend too much effort, get
rained on, or have an argument about food or directions. 

What now, though? We're reasonably confident that our Smew will be the
only tick of the day, so we meander around fairly aimlessly. We manage
to find a couple of hides that look over a scrape; not a lot is about
- a Pheasant is the only bird worthy of comment, despite some stolid
searching for sandpipers. Some attractive grassland provides some
pleasant walking; much scanning of fenceposts for migrants comes to
nothing. 

Further discoveries: a disc golf course (one for another time), a deeply 
annoying dead end and, finally, a rather dilapidated route to Waltham Cross 
(the nearest station after reversing out of the dead end). Not a bad trip; at 
a different time of year this might be worth a more serious visit!
