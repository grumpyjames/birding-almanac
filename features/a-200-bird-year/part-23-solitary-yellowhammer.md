title: Part 23: Solitary Yellowhammer
---

### Solitary Yellowhammer

The next weekend comes and goes; friends are seen, birds are not. I do
my very best to ignore BirdGuides. The weekend after, we're back in Beeston. 
 
Pronoun guidance: AB1 has the BirdGuides subscription. This post covers the
events of June 9-10, 2018.  

#### Still no Lesser Whitethroat

Julie (Aunt, usually found in New Zealand) is over for a bit,
and this is the only time we might manage to intersect. The standard
trip to Attenborough is made; _still_ no Lesser Whitethroat or
Grasshopper Warbler (both now thoroughly in their invisible phase),
but a helpful Green Sandpiper puts in an appearance on the ridge and
furrow area. Even if it does elude anything but the most fleeting of
views. 

#### Bramcote

We make a trip up to Bramcote to see if we can find a more visible
Yellowhammer than Weeting's elusive one from a fortnight ago. Mum
reliably picks up Yellowhammer near Hemlock Scout Camp Site. This
never ceases to amaze me, as it's a _tiny_ area of farmland, trapped
on one side by the A52 and all other sides by bits of Beeston and
Bramcote. This place has some additional memories for me, as I once
inexplicably came third in some sort of scout cross-country
event. To this day I maintain I must have taken some shortcut,
possibly guided by a grinning parent who knew the area rather better
than most of the competitors.

The weather is stubbornly grey - the clouds show no sign of abating,
and there's an occasional gusty wind that makes me think a layer on
top of a jumper might have been sensible. Still, some immediate
positive signs: in a scratchy field just beyond where we've parked, a
collection of Linnets are feeding, and some Goldfinches are hopping
about in the hedgerow bordering the right-hand edge of the field.

A few more Linnets and Goldfinches join the crowds; we spend a bit
of time making sure that's what we are. Chris stops us: he's heard a
Yellowhammer. He reckons it's in the same hedgerow as the Goldfinches,
and finds something perching that he reckons is it. We misinterpret
his directions and tell him off; it's obviously another
Goldfinch. Then we think about it a bit and find the Yellowhammer he's
looking at. Excellent. It sings its heart out for us for a good ten
minutes, before we decide to move on.

A few Stock Doves clinging on to the chimneys of a rather delightful-looking
 house and a nose bleed from Chris are the only other events of
note before we head home in search of warmth and lunch.

A brief review of June reveals a threadbare cupboard contaning four
ticks only, bringing us to 170 for the year. That's not
great. 

Thankfully, on June 29th, we're heading up to Scotland for nine
days of touring around. We've a guide book, four OS maps and a [this
absolute gem](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0956987656) of a
site guide to help us.
