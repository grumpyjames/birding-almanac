title: Part 36: A Soggy End To August
---

### A Soggy End To August

August is not traditionally a productive birding month - towards the end of
the month, however, things start to happen.

Pronoun guidance: AB1 fails to traverse the Thames. This post covers the
events of well, bits of August in 2018. Mostly the 26th. Cover image lazily
stolen from a trip earlier in the year - the main locations in this post
weren't that photogenic!

#### August in summary

We've already collected most of what could be August targets in a monster
July performance. Very few attempts at increasing the total occur, as a result. 

Two fine friends marry outside in Shropshire, and set a record for
'most birds of prey visible during a wedding', with Buzzard, Red Kite
and Peregrine all making an appearance. A nearby wooded area of
Wenlock Edge has young flycatchers and warblers galore, but nothing
new for the year. The valley below has poorly maintained paths and, by
the end of Sunday, my ill-advisedly short trouser adorned legs are
somewhat scratched, and my shoes wet.

#### A late Black Tern opportunity?

Several Black Terns are repeatedly reported off Gallions Reach. I've been
looking for an excuse to acquaint myself with that area of the Thames
for a while - the penultimate weekend of August seems like a good one.

The weather has other ideas. It's a very damp looking day even as
I head out. An hour on the tube and DLR only worsens conditions - it's
a borderline downpour as I touch out at Gallions Reach DLR. Here's
hoping my telescope's jacket is waterproof - it certainly claims to
be.

Access to the Thames on the North side is, to start with, quite simple
- there's what feels like the start of a promenade area next to some
new build apartment blocks. It isn't exactly welcoming (the promenade
abruptly ends as the housing development stops and becomes a heavily
fenced off patch of rough undeveloped land) but it does offer a good
view of a decent section of river.

A quick scan with the bins finds a maelstrom of gulls and terns a
couple of hundred metres downriver. Enough of an excuse to try the
scope, at least.

The usual faff with the tripod quickly dispensed with, I now peer at
the gull/tern cloud. They're almost exactly far away enough to make
this difficult - even with the scope, the number of eye pixels taken
up by each bird makes it tricky to differentiate between gull and
tern, never mind between gull and tern species.

Thankfully, even at this time of year, Black Tern should still retain
enough of its naming plumage to be differentiable. This should just be
a waiting game if the birds are present, and, before long, I find a
couple of birds flying around in a tern like fashion, while being
altogether too small and dark to be Common Terns. An annoyingly crappy
view of Black Tern, but Black Tern nonetheless.

#### Not the Thames Path

It would, I decide, be good to have a better view. A brief look at
Google Maps' satellite view suggests that may be possible. Ideally,
one would use what looks like a perfectly serviceable riverside path,
but it is locked up behind a serious looking fence. We must be far
enough East that the Thames Path is no longer a thing - a real shame!
I make a mental note to write to someone about this and complain.

To go downstream then, we'll have to go in, along, and out again. I
turn right at the show house for what the inaccessible wasteland will
eventually be covered with. Would it be so hard for them to keep
access to the river open?

This road is pretty miserable - Buddleia-strewn abandoned concrete
lots on both sides, with no sign of the river at all. A roundabout
that once offered a road towards the river now offers more giant
fencing and gates equipped with very serious notices (and, more
importantly, locks and spikes). I am repelled.

The next option is a small retail park, which looks as if it may have,
from its rear, a path that eventually allows river access. All trace
of it has disappeared under a thicket of brambles.

The retail park does allow a brief break for lunch. The outlet of
Boots as at the "we're going to throw these sandwiches out in ten
minutes" stage, so it's a high calorie, high value, mediocre quality
(2 sets of sandwiches: Â£1.50 total) affair.

Refreshed, I am ready for my final assault on the river. A marked
footpath is available from the exit of the retail park. It has _users_
- I see four other people and a cyclist using it. It looks like I may
be able to enter Beckton sewage works from this path; which ought to
avail me of a better view of these terns. [Dave Morrison](http://davemobirding.blogspot.com/) often birds
from the sewage works, so that must surely work.

Once again though, I am stymied. This is not really a path, and there
is no way through these giant gates. The only other access options are
another twenty minutes through what my SimCity trained brain is now
labelling as 'low density commercial/industrial zoning, i.e minging'
areas. And these first few attempts have taken their toll, not least
upon my coat, which is feeling rather brambled. A crappy view is going
to have to do.

Having vainly pursued a better view without a real plan, I'm now a
forty minute bus from useful transport. I console myself by eating
sandwich number two, and then start the journey home. Next time I'm
going to try this from the other side of the river.

A rather relaxed August with only a single tick. 204.
