### Bird reports

This is an obscenely dedicated trip by a bunch of very dedicated Americans:

They really liked highway 175 between Valle Nacional and Oaxaca City
They found some stuff at Monte Alban, and recommend avoiding it on the free day.

They spend a lot of their evening's travelling. That sounds arduous

This one is more about the area South of Oaxaca City:

Want:

   Is June rubbish?
   Can we self-guide easily?
   If we were to have a guide for two to three days of this, which ones?
   Would you offer a short tour at this time, and if so, could you roughly 
   describe an itinerary and cost?

Hello,

We are two birders who are going to be in Oaxaca City for a wedding in June 
this year. We're hoping to have a week or so free to do some birding in Oaxaca 
more widely afterwards.

We have a few specific questions:

1. Is June a sensible month to go birding in Oaxaca?
    (Most of the online tours seem to be March/April)
2. Is it possible/sensible to self-guide at all (we like having a guide, but we 
also like exploring ourselves!)
3. Would you be interested in taking us on a tour in June?
    And if so, what itinerary would you recommend?
    
We're still at a very early stage of planning this holiday, so please don't 
spend too much time on a detailed answer - really, we're trying to work out 
whether we can do a reasonable amount of birding in a week, or whether we 
should stay longer.

Thanks in advance,
James and Emma.
