### Barnes WWT

A WWT reserve smack bang in TfL Zone 2. That can't possible work, can
it? Surprisingly, it can.

### Getting there

Public transport options are pretty good - either get National Rail to
Barnes and then a short bus trip (or ten minute walk) or tube to
Hammersmith and grab a bus (slightly longer, walk probably less
pointful) from there.

There is good access from the Thames path if you're on a bike coming
from the East.

If you're in the same quadrant of London as the reserve (i.e South
West) driving isn't totally insane and there is a sizeable car park.

### How to do it

Like all WWT reserves, Barnes is well marketed and well visited - be
prepared to share the reserve with a wide range of birding enthusiasm
levels, from serious scope spotters to occasional hordes of children
attempting but failing to be quiet (it's just too exciting).

One upside to Barnes' urban location is that it is _very_ well birded;
it seems to be blessed with some extremely patient folk, I suspect not
least because its two signature rarities (Bittern and Jack Snipe)
often require a bit of hard work to find.

Before you continue - open [the official
map](https://www.wwt.org.uk/userfiles/images/Centre%20maps/WWTLondon-MAP.jpg);
it has some names I'm going to rely on.

If you want any hope at all of piece and quiet and you're visiting on
a weekend, be at Barnes when it opens. Visit the sightings board in
the courtyard to catch up with the latest news, and have a quick look
out from the observatory's giant glass frontage - I've been lucky
enough to waltz straight on to a Bittern in there before.

#### A quick Bittern side note

I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that this is probably the
most reliable place in the UK to see Bittern in the Winter. The site
is small, well birded, well stocked (reports of up to five Bitterns on
a single day) and well reported, so if there is a Bittern:

  Someone will spot it
  It'll usually be reported (Check [WWT London Twitter](https://twitter.com/wwtlondon?lang=en))
  You should be able to get to where it's been seen before it disappears

To maximise your chances of a decent view:

  Time your visit to intersect with a cold, clear, dry, still day in winter
  Keep an eye out for bittern news
  Don't be ashamed of bailing half way across the reserve to get on it

#### Enough Bittern

Once you've convinced yourself the view from the observatory is free
of further interest (or the annoying lack of focus the windows cause
get the better of you), I would head out towards the Headley hide.

On the way, keep your eyes open; the hedgerow separating the
collection from the reserve proper often has a reed bunting or a
Cetti's or two making an appearance.

Headley should be a relatively quick stop, unless it's a freezing cold
day, in which case you may find it's warmth rather trickier to
leave. Scan the reedbed in front carefully; it could have Bittern or
Water Rail hiding within it. I've seen Stock Dove and Green Woodpecker
meandering around on the grassy bit that protrudes from the right side
of the hide, so give that a strong examination as well. Once you get
bored enough to start looking at gulls, it's probably time to move on.

Take whatever route you like to the wild side hide. In spring/summer
you should have a pleasant accompaniment of warbler background; in
colder months, you might get something interesting amidst the tit
flocks.

My experience of the wild side hide varies wildly. In Autumn/Winter, I
mostly visit for completeness - there might be a Pintail or two at the
far end of the reservoir pond. Sometimes a vagrant (Ring necked duck,
duck that must not be named) turns up here. More likely there will not
be very much at all.

In Spring/Summer, it offers the best view of the two grassy edges (and
fencing) of the grazing marsh. Pipits (meadow, water, some occasional
claims of more exciting varieties), wagtails (pied, grey and yellow)
and chats (stone and whin) should be carefully looked for.

Head back to the centre when you're finished; strongly consider
whether you need coffee, a snack, or a use of the facilities; I
usually require at least one.

Right - you should now be ready for the second half of the
reserve. Both hides on the way to Peacock Tower are worth a visit;
each allow some tricky part of the reedbed to be viewer; have a good
check (take your time!) if you're looking for Bittern, and don't
exclude the reeds nearest the hide. If you get bored of staring at
reeds, have a break and check the edges of the islands you can see for
waders; Snipe is likely, as is Redshank.

If you reach Peacock Tower Bitternless, you're probably going to stay
that way unless you hang around 'til dusk and catch one in flight. The
Tower is much better for spying on the wader scrape and the grazing
marsh; if there are interesting waders on the sight they'll almost
certainly be found from the Tower.

While you wait for something of interest to turn up, or one of the
professionals to find a near-impossible Jack Snipe, two of the Tower's
more fixed offerings may be on show. Have a good look at Charing Cross
Hospital; a pair of Peregrines nest on it, and frequently end up
sitting on the railings on the side visible from the reserve. In the
warmer months, the Tower comes with Sand Martins - there's an obvious
bank where they nest of the right hand side of the scrape.

In general, once I'm tired of the Tower I'm ready to go home - you
might find on a super quiet day that all of the above has taken all of
ninety minutes. If, at that point, it isn't freezing cold, consider
taking the long way back via the rear of the sheltered lagoon, it's a
pleasant walk, and often has plenty of littlies to keep one
entertained.
