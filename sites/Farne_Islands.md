### Farne Islands

An excellent (the best?) place to get near to Britain's cliff nesting
birds.

### Getting there

You will need to take a boat from Seahouses. Getting to Seahouses is
best done by car; there are rumours of buses. Go in late May-June for
the best views of Puffins with beaks full of sand-eels, and for the
full on terns-pecking-at-your-head experiences.

Boats will allow you to land on only two of the islands as part of
normal operation: Staple Island and Inner Farne. The amount of swell
can make one or the other inaccessible - ask on the day for more
information. It's worth booking if you intend to go on a weekend or
public holiday.

Alighting on both islands is often an option. On our first visit we
did just that. We found that Staple offers closer encounters with
puffins (3-4m rather than 9-10), higher numbers of stacked auks, and
is considerably more peaceful, but... 

...Inner Farne, on the other hand, is alive with the sound of terns; all
of Common, Arctic and Sandwich can easily be seen nesting here, _in
addition_ to the auks (although they are in less spectacular
numbers). Inner Farne also has more obviously nesting Eiders. Both
islands should have obviously nesting Kittiwake, Shag, and Fulmar (in
decreasing frequency order).

We probably wouldn't do both again in the same day - the time allotted
on both islands was too long; I resorted to reading the bird book at
points.

All boat trips will, at the very least, give a circuit of almost all
the islands (and the seal colony!); this should yield most of the
species you'd be hoping for (possibly less Rock Pipit) albeit not
quite at the closeness you get if you land.

Rarity wise - occasionally things do turn up, but often only on the
non-publicly accessible islands.

### Facilities

There are toilets and an information centre on Inner Farne. Staple
Island has no such amenities, and very little cover.

original boat tour people. They have excellent chat, and will happily
hunt around for a cetacean or two if they're about.

### Eat / Drink / Stay

Before boarding, a visit to [Trotters Family
Bakers](http://www.trottersfamilybakers.co.uk/index.php?page=seahouses-shop)
is a necessity - fantastic hand made sandwiches and cakes at very reasonable
prices.

The Olde Ship Inn does a reasonable pint and has an outdoor area
ideally suited for giving the Eiders and Turnstones that frequent the
harbour a good staring at.
