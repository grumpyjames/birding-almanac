### Thursley Common

Shrike haven in the A3 corridor also offers one of the better
opportunities to catch up with otherwise hard to find heathland birds.

### Getting there

Can be a struggle. Milford is the nearest station, but then getting to
the common without being mown down trying to cross the A3 is rather
trickier. I have managed to cycle to the Moat car park successfully at
least once in the past; using a car might be the most sensible way to
get here, to be frank.

### Facilities

Absent.

### How to do it

Thursley is good all year round, but to catch up with its most
crepuscular claim to fame you'll need to visit between May and
August. For once, a leisurely post lunch start might be best in these
circumstances, unless you have the stamina for a dawn until dusk
birding session.

If you're outside that time period; fear not, Thursley may still grant
you the gift of a wintering shrike, or, failing that, a fleeting view
of a Dartford Warbler or two. In both cases we would guess that the
earlier you arrive the more likely you'll have success; particularly
in the Dartford's case, disturbance is not likely to be helpful.

In both cases, more patience than you might otherwise think is going
to be required. Thursley is a mix of coniferous woodland and
heathland, neither of which will give up their secrets easily. Be
prepared to see very little and to be satisfied with the amazing
scenery, then if something does turn up, so much the better.
